According to developmental psychology research, identity formation is one of the central tasks of adolescence.

This process involves trying out different roles, values, and beliefs to discover who you truly are. Remember, identity development is a journey, not a destination, and it's okay to feel uncertain as you explore different possibilities.",

According to Jean Piaget's theory, children between ages 2 and 7 are in the 'preoperational stage' where they naturally think from their own perspective and have difficulty understanding that others might see things differently. This isn't selfishness in the adult sense - it's simply how their developing brain works. Around age 6-7, children typically begin to develop 'theory of mind' and can better understand other people's thoughts and feelings. For now, you can help by gently pointing out other perspectives: 'How do you think your sister feels when...' but don't expect them to fully grasp it yet.",

Attachment theory, developed by John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth, confirms that early emotional bonds with caregivers do indeed influence our relationship patterns throughout life. If you experienced inconsistent or unresponsive caregiving, you might have developed what's called an 'insecure attachment style.' However, it's important to know that attachment patterns aren't fixed - they can change through healing relationships, therapy, and conscious effort. Many people successfully develop more secure relationship patterns in adulthood, even after difficult childhoods. Understanding these patterns is actually the first step toward changing them.
